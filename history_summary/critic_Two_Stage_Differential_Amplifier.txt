Design Rules:

1. **Tradeoffs in performance metrics:**
   - **Tradeoff (gain, CMRR):** Increasing gain may reduce CMRR due to enhanced sensitivity to mismatch in the differential pair transistors.
   - **Tradeoff (GBW, PM):** Increasing GBW may reduce phase margin due to the increased speed of the response, which can lead to stability issues if not properly compensated.

2. **Critical substructures and parameters:**
   - **Differential pair substructure:** Critical parameters l1, w1, l3, w3 (not l2, w2) affect gain, as these are the lengths and widths of the transistors directly connected to the input.
   - **Current mirror substructure:** Critical parameters l5, w5, l6, w6 affect CMRR, as these are involved in mirroring the bias current, thus ensuring consistent operation of the differential pair.
   - **Output stage substructure:** Critical parameters l7, w7, l8, w8 affect GBW, as these are the dimensions of the transistors in the output stage that amplify the signal to drive the load.
   - **Load resistor substructure:** Critical parameter r1 affects phase margin, as it is part of the feedback network that influences the overall stability of the amplifier.

3. **Optimizing individual performance metrics:**
   - **For gain:** Increase w1 and w3 (not w2) while maintaining w1/l1 = w3/l3 to ensure symmetry in the differential pair, which is crucial for maximizing gain.
   - **For CMRR:** Adjust l5, w5, l6, w6 to ensure precise current mirroring, which helps in minimizing common-mode signals.
   - **For GBW:** Tune l7, w7, l8, w8 to optimize the output stageâ€™s response to high-frequency signals.
   - **For phase margin:** Adjust r1 to optimize the stability margin by fine-tuning the feedback factor.

4. **Optimizing parameters considering tradeoffs:**
   - **To optimize gain and CMRR tradeoff:** Balance parameters w1, w3 (not w2), w5, w6 to achieve desired levels of gain while maintaining good CMRR.
   - **To optimize GBW and phase margin tradeoff:** Adjust parameters l7, w7, l8, w8, and r1

Use the above information to find common sub-structures and optimize the parameters of the next circuit.
